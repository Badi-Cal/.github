The project 

The aim is to create a site that helps people organize events and publicize them. We use Google Calendar to store events. Publication shall be through email, twitter, instagram, WhatsApp. Here the site helps by automating the distribution of the event. Events can be public or private. The primary community is the Bahá’í community. As such, there is a focus on compatibility between Gregorian and Badí Calendars. Ultimately this is for general use. Other features are GeoIP lookup, for a default view of nearby events and calculating sunset for proper display of Badí dates. A Google account on the site to which users can share their events for a general publicly viewable event.

When a user registers they grant access to create events on their calendar. We then add our calendar user as a guest to the event they create on our site. This doesn’t create lists (ACLs) of users in our calendar. The relationship exists with the event only. Only the owner can change it or our internal user. Others can’t. Also they now have their event on their calendar.
